# CyberSec-RoadMap (Bran-Strin)

This repo is my personal journey through the cybersecurity landscape, based on [https://roadmap.sh/cyber-security](https://roadmap.sh/cyber-security).

I'm using this as a framework to organize my thoughts, test ideas in my homelab, and reflect on how I learn and apply each concept. It's not a boot camp assignment or formal schoolwork -- just raw documentation as I go.

## Why I'm Doing This

- To make my learning **visible**, not just personal
- To track and build a body of work that shows I understand more than just definitions.
- To eventually help others think like me -- curious, chaotic, and tring to find signal in all the noise.

## What's Inside

Each folder or markdownfile in this repo corresponds to a section from the roadmap. Inside you'll find:

- **Topic Summaries** in my own words
- **Hands-on lab reflections** (When I build or test something)
- **Thoughts on real-world application**
- **Write-ups** on anything that sparks a deeper idea

## Related Work

If you're interested in more experimental or deeper signal-related work, check out my other repo: 
[https://github.com/Sisu-Sus/Signal_Path](https://github.com/Sisu-Sus/Signal_Path)
Where I dig into entropy, detection theory, modulation, and behavioral control systems.

## Who Might Care

- Other self-taught cybersecurity learners
- Hiring managers looking for proof of hands-on thinking
- People who like ideas explained through **what they are, what they mean, and how I tested them**
