# Common Commands

## Roadmap.sh Summary:
Common OS commands are essential for interacting with a system's shell or command-line interface (CLI). These commands allow users to perform a wide range of tasks, such as navigating the file system, managing files and directories, checking system status, and administering processes. Below are some commonly used commands across Unix/Linux and Windows operating systems:

- Navigating the File System:
    Unix/Linux: ls (list files), cd (change directory), pwd (print working directory)
    Windows: dir (list files), cd (change directory), echo %cd% (print working directory)

- File and Directory Management:
    Unix/Linux: cp (copy files), mv (move/rename files), rm (remove files), mkdir (create directory)
    Windows: copy (copy files), move (move/rename files), del (delete files), mkdir (create directory)

- System Information and Process:
    Unix/Linux: top or htop (view running processes), ps (list processes), df (disk usage), uname (system info)
    Windows: tasklist (list processes), taskkill (kill process), systeminfo (system details)

- File Permissions and Ownership:
    Unix/Linux: chmod (change file permissions), chown (change file ownership)
    Windows: icacls (modify access control lists), attrib (change file attributes)

- Network Commands:
    Unix/Linux: ping (test network connection), ifconfig or ip (network interface configuration), netstat (network statistics)

These commands form the foundation of interacting with an managing an OS via the command line, providing greater control over system operations compared to graphical interfaces,
