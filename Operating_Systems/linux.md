# Linux

## Roadmap.sh Summary:
Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel first release by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It forms the core of various operating systems known as Linux distributions. Linux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, making it popular for servers, embedded systems, and increasingly for desktop use. It supports a wide range of hardware and offers powerful command-line interfaces alongside graphical user interfaces. Linux adheres to Unix principles, emphasizing modularity and the philosophy of "do one thing and do it well." Its open-source nature allows for community-driven development and customization. Linux is widely used in cloud computer, supercomputers, and Android Devices, and is a fundemental component of the Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP (LAMP) web server stack.

I, as most Linux nerds, could talk all day about this. Again I suggest just reading [Debian Installation Guide](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/) to start.
