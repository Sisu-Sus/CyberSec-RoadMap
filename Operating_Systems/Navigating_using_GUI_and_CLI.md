# Navigating Using GUI and CLI

## Roadmap Summary:
### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with a software program, computer, or network device using images, icons, and visual indicators. The GUI is designed to make the user expeirience more intuitive, as it enable users to perform tasks using a mouse and a keyboard without having to delve into complex commands. Most modern operating systems (Windows, macOS, and Linux) offer GUIs as the primary means of interaction.

Advantages of GUI:
  - User-friendly and visually appealling
  - Easier for beginners to learn and navigate
  - Reduces the need to memorize complex commands

Disadvantages of GUI:
  - Consumes more system resources (memory, CPU) than CLI
  - Some advanced features might not be available or as quickly accessible as compared to CLI

### Command Line Interace (CLI)
A command Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with computer programs or network devices directly through commands that are entered via a keyboard. CLIs are used in a variety of contexts, including operating systems (e.g, Windows Command Prompt or Powershell, macOS Terminal, and Linux shell), network devices(such as routers and switches), and some software applications:

Advantages of CLI:
  - Faster and more efficient in performing tasks once commands are known
  - Requires fewer system resources (memory, CPU) than GUI
  - Provides more control and advanced features for experienced users

Disadvantages of CLI:
  - Git gud nerd ( It was hard for me at first due to steep learning curve )
  - Requires memorization or reference material for commands and syntax. ( Practice, if you think you can automate something spend the time to do it. That small project will literally blast your XP levels in the field)

By understanding how to navigate and use both GUI and CLI, you will be better equipped to manage and secure computer systems and network devices, as well as perform various cyber security tasks that may require a combination of these interfaces. It is essential to be familiar with both methods, as some tasks may require the precision and control offer by CLI, while others may be more efficiently performed using GUI.
