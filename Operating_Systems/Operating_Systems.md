# Operating Systems

## Roadmap.sh Summary:
Operating Systems (OS) are software that manage computer hardware and provide a platform for applications to run. They hand essential functions such as managing memory, processing tasks, controlling input and output devices, and facilitating file management. Key examples include Windows, macOS, Linux, and Unix. Each operating system offers different features and interfaces, tailored to specific user needs or system reuirements, from desktop computing to server management and embedded systems.

I would like to add that if you are trying a new Linux distro, I chose to go with Debian as my first choice. They have  really nice write ups for the entire system and if you are willing to put the time in, you too can evolve backwards into a CLI monkey like me. One bonus of starting with a raw Debian setup -- Debian is the base Distro for many others such as Ubuntu and Hackermans favorite, Kali Linux.
