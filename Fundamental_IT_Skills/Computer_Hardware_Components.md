# Computer Hardware Components
Computer hardware comprises the physical components of a computing system, collectively enabling the execution of computational tasks. This document provides an overview of key hardware elements and their respective functions.

1. Central Processing Unit (CPU): The CPU serves as the primary processing unit within the system. It fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and executes operations on data. Performance is typically characterized by clock speed (measured in GHz), core count, and instruction set architecture (ISA). Modern CPUs often incorporate integrated graphics processing units (iGPUs) for basic display functionality.

2. Motherboard: The motherboard functions as the central printed circuit board (PCB) facilitating communication and power distribution between various hardware components. It provides slots and connectors for the CPU, RAM, expansion cards (e.g., GPUs), storage devices, and peripherals. Chipset architecture on the motherboard dictates supported features and compatibility with different CPUs and memory modules.

3. Random Access Memory (RAM): RAM is volatile semiconductor memory used to store data and program instructions currently in use by the CPU. Its primary advantage lies in its rapid access speeds compared to persistent storage solutions. RAM capacity (measured in GB) and speed (characterized by timings and frequency, e.g., DDR5-6000 CL30) significantly impact system performance.

4. Storage Devices: Persistent data storage is provided by devices such as Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and Solid State Drives (SSDs). * Hard Disk Drives (HDDs): Utilize magnetic platters to store data, offering high capacity at a lower cost per gigabyte. Performance is limited by rotational speed (RPM) and seek time. * Solid State Drives (SSDs): Employ flash memory for data storage, providing significantly faster access times and improved durability compared to HDDs. SSD performance is often measured in read/write speeds (MB/s). NVMe SSDs leverage the PCIe interface for even higher bandwidth.

5. Power Supply Unit (PSU): The PSU converts alternating current (AC) from a power source into direct current (DC) voltages required by the various system components. PSU capacity is rated in watts and efficiency is typically indicated by an 80+ certification level (e.g., 80+ Bronze, Gold, Platinum).

6. Graphics Processing Unit (GPU): GPUs are specialized processors designed to accelerate graphics rendering tasks. They are crucial for applications such as gaming, video editing, machine learning (particularly deep learning), and scientific visualization. GPU performance is characterized by factors like core count, memory bandwidth, and clock speed. GPUs can be integrated into the CPU (iGPU) or exist as discrete add-in cards.

7. Input/Output (I/O) Devices: These devices facilitate user interaction with the system: * Input Devices: Examples include keyboards, mice, trackpads, microphones, and scanners. * Output Devices: Examples include monitors, printers, speakers, and projectors. Connectivity is typically achieved through interfaces like USB, HDMI, DisplayPort, and audio jacks.

The synergistic operation of these hardware components enables a computer system to execute complex tasks and provide a platform for diverse applications.
