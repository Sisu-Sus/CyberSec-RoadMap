# Computer Hardware Components
Computer hardware components are the pyhsical parts of a computer system that work togther to pergorm computing tasks. The key components include the Central Processing Unit (CPU), which is the "brain" of the computer responible for executing instructions and processing data. The motherboard is the main circuit board that connects and allows communication between the CPU, memory, and other hardware. Random Access Memory (RAM) serves as the computer's short-term memory, storing data that is actively being used by the CPU for quick access.

The storage device, such as a Hard Disk Drive (HDD) or Solid-State Drive (SSD), is where data is permanently stored, including the operating system, applications, and files. The power supply unit (PSU) provides the necessary electrical power to run the components. Grapics Processing Units (GPU), dedicated for rendering images and videos, are important for tasks like gaming, video editing, and machine learning. Additionally, input devices like keyboards and mice, and output devices like monitors and printers, enable users to interact with the system. Together, these components make up the essential hardware of a computer, enabling it to perform various functions.

### Motherboard
The motherboard acts as the hub that conects all the different pieces of hardware on the computer together, coordinating power to each piece.

### CPU
The CPU acts as the brains for the PC, it process the data at a speed known as the 'clock' speed which is measured in gigahertz (GHz)

### RAM
Computer RAM is responsible for temporarily stroring data for programs so that it is immediately accessible. It can be refferred to as 'volatile' as the data is erased when the PC reboots.

RAM plays an integral part in computing efficiently and proves vital for image renderring and other tasks that may involve multi-tasking.

### SSD/HDD

These are the two types of storage devices responsible for saving data on your PC. HDDs are older technology that work by writing binary data onto spinning magnetic disks called platters, that rotate at highspeed. SSDs are a newer type of drive that store data on static NAND flash memory chips. SSDs are superior.

### GPU

The GPU is responsible for processing graphical data. Although GPU upgrades are generally for gaming, video work, or visual performance, modern GPUs also provide additional computational workload beyond just rendering, making them an extension of the central processing unit.

### PSU

The PSU is responsible for passing electricity to the motherboard for the rest of the hardware. It is important to use rated PSU's to effectively power your PC and not burn your house down. ( I found a 500w for $40 with no rating that looked like it was ready to party out of the box)
