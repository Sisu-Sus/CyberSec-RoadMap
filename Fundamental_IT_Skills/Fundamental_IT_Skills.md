# Fundamental IT Skills
A strong foundation in core IT skills is essential for success in cybersecurity. These foundational elements extend beyond just security tools; they encompass a broad understanding of how technology works. Key areas include computer hardware and software principles, networking fundamentals, and operating system expertise (with a focus on Windows and Linux). Increasingly, proficiency in at least one programming langauge - Python or JavaScript are popular choices - is vital for automating tasks and scripting solutions. Database management skills, particularly with SQL, are crucual for data handling and security. With the rise of cloud computing, familiarity with platforms like AWS or Azure is now a necessity. Building on this base, understanding core cybersecurity concepts such as encryption, access control, and common attack methods provides a solid starting point for more specialized work. Finally, practical skills like troubleshooting, log analysis, and basic web technology knowledge are invaluable. Mastering these fundamental IT skills empowers cybersecurity professionals to effectively safeguard systems, pinpoint vulnerabilities, and respond to incidents in today's complex digital environment.

### Feel Like Building Something?
One resource I can personally recommend and used is [https://automatetheboringstuff.com](https://automatetheboringstuff.com) for python. Theres many books to read through and I feel it's a great starting point if you are here just because you like how hackerman sounds. Many people struggle with being overwhelmed and just learning some syntax and how a langauge works can help greatly, especially when you have no clue why something isn't   *--or is--*   working right.

### IT Skills

- Coding:
  Knowledge of coding is a foundational requirement for many IT professionals

- Communication:
  Communication skills refer to the ability to interact effectively with those around you, both verbally and in writing. I would like to add that communication is really key for problem solving. Try to communicate in a positive and effective manor.

- Organization:
  IT professionals commonly work on multiple projects or multiple aspects of a job simultaneously, making it important to be organized. I would personally recommend finding a good workflow for your workstation. I personally use Linux with a shell allowing me to switch between common tasks almost instantly. I suggest spending the time to work on your own lab/PC for a day and get comfortable being quick on something.

- Leadership: Professionals with developed leadership skills may be able to motivate others and be ascended to a managerial position.

- Analytical: You will likely work on a variety of projects that require you to analyze different types of activity. Being able to think analytically is said to help discover effective solutions.

- Troubleshooting: Working on troublehshooting skills and using different resources, vastly improves your workflow. If you have to use ChatGPT to solve the same issue 5 times, you are not being effective.

- Time Management: Maximizing your output with time management is an effective skill to master. Being able to focus effectively and use your time wisely will greatly help you not feel overwhelmed, especially in the beginning. Try to make small goals. I would start with maybe one page a day, or one topic a day, or one langauge a day -- **Whatever your rate is, it's fast enough. **
