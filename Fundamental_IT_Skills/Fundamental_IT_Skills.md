# Fundamental IT Skills

## Roadmap.sh Summary:
Fundamental IT skills form the  backbone of cybersecurity proficiency and encompass a broad range of technical knowledge. These skills include understanding computer hardware and software, networking concepts, and operating systems (particularly Windows and Linux). Proficiency in a least one programming langauge, such as Python or JavaScript, is increasingly important in automation and scripting tasks. Database management, including SQL, is crucial for handling and securing data. Knowledge of cloud computing platforms like AWS or Azure is becoming essential as organizations migrate to cloud environments. Familiarity with basic cybersecurity concepts such as encryption, access control, and common attack vectors provides a foundation for more advanced security work. Additionally, troubleshooting skills, the ability to interpret logs, and a basic understanding of webtechnologies are vital. These fundamental IT skills enable cybersecurity professionals to reffectively protect systems, identify vulnerabilities, and respond to incidents in increasingly complex technological landscapes.

### Feel Like Building Something?
One resource I can personally recommend and used is [https://automatetheboringstuff.com](https://automatetheboringstuff.com) for python. Theres many books to read through and I feel it's a great starting point if you are here just because you like how hackerman sounds. Many people struggle with being overwhelmed and just learning some syntax and how a langauge works can help greatly, especially when you have no clue why some this isn't   --*or is*--   working right.
