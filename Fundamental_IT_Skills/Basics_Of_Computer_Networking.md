# Basics of Computer Networking

## Computer Networking Fundamentals
This document provides a detailed overview of computer networking principles, essential for cybersecurity professionals. It assumes familiarity with basic computing concepts but aims to clarify underlying mechanisms and potential vulnerabilities.

### Core Concepts & Terminology
**Network Topology:** The physical or logical arrangement of devices in a network. Common topologies include:
| Topology | Explanation |
|---|---|
| Bus | Simple, single cable; vulnerable to breaks and collisions. (Rarely used today) |
| Star | Central hub/switch connects all nodes; easier management & fault isolation but relies on the central device. |
| Ring | Data travels in a circular path; susceptible to single point of failure. (Historically used, less common now). |
| Mesh | Nodes are interconnected with multiple paths; highly resilient but complex and expensive. |

**Network Types:** Categorized by scale and access:
| Network Type | Explanation |
|---|---|
| LAN (Local Area Network) | Confined to a limited geographical area (e.g., home, office). |
| WAN (Wide Area Network) | Spans large geographical areas (e.g., the internet). |
| MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) | Connects LANs within a city or metropolitan area. |
| VPN (Virtual Private Network) | Creates a secure, encrypted connection over a public network (like the Internet), effectively extending a private network. |
