# Basics of Computer Networking

## Computer Networking Fundamentals
This document provides a detailed overview of computer networking principles, essential for cybersecurity professionals. It assumes familiarity with basic computing concepts but aims to clarify underlying mechanisms and potential vulnerabilities.

### Core Concepts & Terminology
Network Topology: The physical or logical arrangement of devices in a network. Common topologies include:
Bus: Simple, single cable; vulnerable to breaks and collisions. (Rarely used today)
Star: Central hub/switch connects all nodes; easier management & fault isolation but relies on the central device.
Ring: Data travels in a circular path; susceptible to single point of failure. (Historically used, less common now).
Mesh: Nodes are interconnected with multiple paths; highly resilient but complex and expensive.
