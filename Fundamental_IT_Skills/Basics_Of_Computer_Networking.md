# Basics of Computer Networking

## Roadmap.sh Summary:
### Basics of Computer Networking
Computer Networking is the practice of connecting computers and devices to share data and resources. It involves the use of protocols like TCP/IP for communication, hardware such as routers and switches for directing traffic, and various topologies (e.g., star, mesh, bus) for organizing connections. Networks can be categorized by size and scope, from small Local Area Networks ( LANs ) to Wide Area Networks ( WANs ) that span large geographical areas. Key concepts include IP addressing, subnetting, DNS for name resolution, and network security measures. Understanding networking basics is crucial for managing data flow, troubleshooting connectivity issues, and ensuring efficient communication in modern computing environments.

### Switches, Routers, and Wireless Access Points
Switches, routers, and wireless access points are the essential network basics. Through them, devices connected to your network can communicate with one another and with other networks, like the Internet. Switches, routers, and wireless access points perform very different functions in a network.

### Switches
Switches are the foundation of most business networks. A switch acts as a controller, conencting computers, printers, and servers to a network in a building or a campus. Switches allow devices on your network to communicate with each other, as well as with other networks, creating a network of shared resources. Through information sharing and resource allocation, switches save money and increase productivity.

### Routers
Routers connect multiple networks together. They also connect computers on those networks to the Internet. Routers enable all networked computers to share a single Internet connection, which saves money.

A router acts as a dispatcher. It analyzes data being sent across a network, chooses the best route for data to travel, and sends it on its way.

Routers can also provide addition functions such as firewalls, Virtual Private Networks (VPN), or an Internet Protocol (IP) communications system.

### Access Points (AP)
An AP allows devices to connect to the wireless network without cables. An AP acts like an amplifier. While routers provide the bandwidth, and AP extends the bandwidth so that the network may support multiple devices. APs can also provide useful data about devices on the network, provide proactive security, and serve many other practical puroposes.


### Wireless Networking
Wireless networking has three deployment options available:
  - Centralized Deployment: The most common type of wireless network system, centralized deployments are tradtionally used in campuses where buildings and networks are in close proximity. This deployment consolidates the wirless network, which makes upgrades easier and facilitates advanced wireless functionality. Controllers are based on-premises and are installed in a centralized location.

  - Converged Deployment: For small campuses or branch offices, converged deployments offer consistency in wireless and wired connections. This deployment converges wired and wireless on one netowrk device -- an access switch -- and performs the dual role of both switch and wireless controller.

  - Cloud-Based Deployment: This system uses the cloud to manage network devices deployed on-premises at different locations. The solution requries Cisco Meraki cloud-managed devices, which provide full visibility of the network through their dashboards.
