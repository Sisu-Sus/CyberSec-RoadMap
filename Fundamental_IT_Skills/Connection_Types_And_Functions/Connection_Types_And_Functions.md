# Connection Types and their Functions
## Roadmap.sh Summary
There are several types of network connections that enable communcication between devices. Methods listed are:

- Ethernet: A wired connection type commonly used in LAN networks. Ethernet is ideal for businesses and environments where reliability is crucial, offering speeds from 100Mbps to several Gbps

- Wi-Fi: Wireless connection that enables devices to connect to a network. While convenient, it can be less reliable and slower than ethernet.

- Bluetooth: A short range wireless technology primarily used for peripherals such as headphones, keyboards, speakers and other devices. Bluetooth is much more vital for personal device communications rather than large network communications.

- Fiber-Optic: Uses light signals to transmit data at very highspeeds over long distances. Fiber is much faster and more reliable than trabitional copper cables, but it is also more expensive to implement.

- Cullular Connections: Cellular connections such as 4G and 5G, allow mobile devices to connect through cellular networks, speeds and reliability vary depending on network.

Each connection type plays a specific role, balancing factors like speed, distance, and convenience.
