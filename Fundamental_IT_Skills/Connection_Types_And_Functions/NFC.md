# NFC - Near Field Communications
## Roadmap.sh Summary
Near Field Communications (NFC) is a short-range wireless technology that allows devices to communicate and exchange data over very short distances, typically up to 4 inches (10cm). NFC a commonly used for applications such as contactless payments, electronic ticketing, and data transfer between devices. It operates at a frequency of 13.56 MHz and supports various modes, including peer-to-peer communication, card emulation, and reader/writer modes. NFC enables quick and secure interactions with minimal setup, making it convenient for mobile payments, access control, and sharing information.

### Modes of Operation
- Peer-to-Peer mode: This mode is compliant with ISO/IEC 18092 standards. It supports communication and the transfer of information between two NFC-compatible devices. At any point, any device can act as the intiator or a target.

- Reader/Writer mode: This mode is compatible with the standards established by ISO/UEC 14443 and FeliCa. It allows devices to read NFC tags, such as those that are integrated into smart posters.

- Card emulation mode: In this mode, data stored on cards such as smart cards are read by an NFC reader. In this mode, a device that is capable of NFC communication connects with an NFC reader in the same way as a smart card can. Users utilize smartphones to gain access to information, such as ticketing information.

  
### Understanding NFC Tags
In order for near-field communication to function properly, tags are necessary. This is especially true for Internet Of Things (IoT) device use cases. These tags are passive devices that allow for communication with active devices. They are categorized based on their formats and capacity. The ISO 14443 Types A and B as well as the Sony FeliCa standard serve as the foundation for the NFC tage type formats. These formats are similar but differ in the way they communicate.

  - Type 1: The standards of the ISO/IEC 14443A standard were used as the basis for this tag. It is a simple and cost-effective tag that is ideal for use in several NFC applications. This tag is read and read/write capable. It has no data collision protection and has a memory of 96 bytes that can be expanded to 2k bytes. It has a communication speed of 106 kbit/s. Examples of common applications of this tag are in mobile payments and connecting Bluetooth devices.

  - Type 2: This tag is similar to the type 1 tag, albeit it is faster. It adheres to the standards outlined in the ISO/IEC 14443A document. This tag is read and read/write capable. It has anti-collision support and a memory if 96 bytes that can be extended to 2k bytes. It also has a communication speed of 106 kbit/s. Examples of common applications of this tag are in the processing of event and transit tickets.

  - Type 3: Based on the JIS X 6319-4 standard, this tag is more prevalent in Japan. This tag is read and read/write capable. It is more expensive per tag and has a memory capacity of up to 1 M byte. It has anti-collision support and a communication speed of 212 kbit/s. Examples of common applications of this tag are in health care devices and membership cards.

  - Type 4: This tag is also similar to the type 1 tag. It is based on the standard specifications ISO/IEC 14443A and ISO/IEC 14443B. This tag is read and read/write capable. It has anti-collision support and a maximum memory capacity size of 32k bytes. It also has a communication speed of 106 kbit/s.
