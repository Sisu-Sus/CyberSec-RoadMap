## Roadmap.sh Summary:
Wifi is a wireless networking technology that allows devices to connect to the internet with each other without physical cables. It uses radio waves to transmit data, typically operating on the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands. WiFi networks are created by wireless routers or access points and can be found in homes, offices, public spaces, and many other locations. The technology follows IEEE 802.11 standard, with newer versions (like WiFi 6 or 802.11ax) offering increased speeds, better performance in crowded areas, and improved energy efficiency. WiFi Enables the proliferation of mobile and smart devices, supporting the Internet of Things (IoT) and allowing for greater flexibility and mobility in network connectivity.

### WiFi Standards (802.11)
- 802.11b (1999): The slowest and least expensive standard. Transmits in the 2.4 GHz frequency band of the radio spectrum. It can handle up to 11 megabits of data per second, and it uses complmentary code keying (CCK) modulation to improve speeds.

- 802.11a (after a): Transmits at 5 GHz and can move up to 54 megabits of data per second. It uses orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), a more efficient coding technique that splits that radio signal into several sub-signals before they reach a receiver. This greatly reduces interference.

- 802.11g: Transmits at 2.4 GHz, but a lot faster -- it can handle up to 54 megabits of data per second. It is faster because it uses the same OFDM coding as 802.11a

- 802.11n (2009): Backwards compatible with a,b, and g. It significantly improved speed and range over its predecessors. For instance, although 802.11g theoretically moves 54 megabits of data per second, it only achieves 24 megabits of data per second  because of network congestion. 802.11n, however, reportedly can achieve speeds as high as 140 megabits per second. 802.11n can transmit up to 4 streams of data, each at a maximum of 150 megabits per second, but most routers only allow for two or three streams.

- 802.11ac (2014): Operates eclusively at a 5 GHz frequency. 802.11ac is backward compatible with 802.11n (and others), with n on the 2.4 GHz band and ac on the 5 GHz band. It is less prone to interference and far faster than its predecessors, pushing a maximum of 450 megabits per second on a single stream, although real-world speeds may be lower. Like 802.11n, it allows for transmission on multipe spatial streams --  up to eight, optionally. It is sometimes called 6G because of its frequency band, sometimes Gigabit Wi-Fi because of its potential to exceed a Gigabit per second on multiple streams and sometimes Very High Throughput (VHT) for the same reason.

- 802.11ax (2019): Also known as WiFi6, it extends the capabilities of 802.11ac in a few key ways. First of all, the new routers allow an even higher data flow rate, up to 9.2 Gbps. WiFi6 also lets manufacturers install many more intennas on one router, accepting multiple connections at once without any worry of interference and slowdown. Some new devices also connect on a higher 6 GHz band, which is about 20 percent faster than 5 GHz in ideal conditions.

- 802.11be (2024): Also known as WiFi7, it offers better range, more connections and faster data rates than any of the previous versions.

Other 802.11 standards focus on specific applications of wireless networks.

### Securing WiFi
- WiFi Protected Access version 2 (WPA2): The successor to WEP and WPA, it is the recommended security standard for WiFi networks. It uses either TKIP or Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), depending upon what you choose at setup. AES is considered the most secure. As with WEP and the initial WPA, WPA2 security involves signing on with a password.

- WPA3: Became the security standard as of 2020. It aims to solve some of the vulnerabilities in WPA2 by putting much more complex encryption on both the router side and client side of the connection.
