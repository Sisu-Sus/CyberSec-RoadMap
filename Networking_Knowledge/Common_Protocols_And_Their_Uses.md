# Common Protocols And Their Uses

## Roadmap.sh Summary:
Networking protocols are essential for facilitating communication between devices and systems across networks. In cybersecurity, understanding these protocols is crucial for indentifying potential vulnerabilities and securing data transmission. Common protocols include TCP/IP, the foundation if internet communication, which ensures reliable data delivery. HTTP and HTTPS are used for web browsing, with HTTPS providing encrypted connections. FTP and SFTP handle file transfers, while SMTP, POP3, and IMAP manage email services. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses, and DHCP automates IP address assignment. SSH enables secure remote access and management of systems. Other important protocols include TLS/SSL for encryption, SNMP for network manegment, and VPN protocols like IPsec and OpenVPN for secure remote connections. Cybersecurity proffessionals must be well-versed in these protocols to effectively monitor network traffic, implemement security measures, and respond to potential threats targeting specific protocol vulnerabilities.
