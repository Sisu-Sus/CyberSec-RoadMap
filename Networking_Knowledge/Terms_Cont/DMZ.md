# Demilitarized Zones (DMZ)
## Introduction & Purpose
A Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) is a network segment that acts as an intermediary layer between an organization's internal network (often referred to as the "trusted" or "private" network) and an external, untrusted network – typically the public internet.  It’s not a physical location but rather a logical separation achieved through network architecture and security devices. The term originates from military terminology referring to areas between opposing forces where conflict is minimized.

The fundamental purpose of a DMZ is to expose specific services or resources to external users while minimizing the risk to the internal network if those exposed systems are compromised.  It provides an additional layer of defense-in-depth, assuming that perimeter security measures (like firewalls) may be breached.
