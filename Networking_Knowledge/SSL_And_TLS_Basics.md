# SSL And TLS Basics

## Understandling SSL/TLS: The Foundation of Secure Web Communication
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols that underpin secure communication on the internet, particularly for web traffic. They provide confidentiality, integrity, and authentication - essential components of online security. These protocols work by encrypting data exchanged between clients (like your browser) and servers.

The core function is to prevent eavesdropping; even if an attacker intercepts network packets, they won't be able to decipher the encrypted content without the correct decryption keys.

### A Critical Evolution: The Deprecation of SSL

It's important to understand that SSL has been superseded by TLS due to identified security vulnerabilities. Modern Web browsers have largely phased out support for SSL, recognizing its inherent risks. This isn't a minor update; it represents a shift in internet security practices.

### TLS: The Current Standard

TLS is the successor to SSL and incorporates numerous improvements addressing the weaknesses found in earlier verisons of SSL. It's now the industry standard for securing web communications and offers enhanced protection against various attacks. Websites utilizing TLS typically display "https://" in thier URLs, indicating a secure connection.
