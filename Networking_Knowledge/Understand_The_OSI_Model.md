# Understand The OSI Model

## Roadmap.sh Summary:
The Open Systems Interconnection(OSI) Model is a conceptual framework that describes how data communication occurs between devices in a network. It consists of seven layers, each with specific fucntions:

1. Physical - Deals with physical transmission media
2. Data Link - Handles error-free transfer between adjacent nodes
3. Network - Manages addressing and routing
4. Transport - Ensure end-to-end data delivery and flow control
5. Session - Establishes, manages, and terminates connections
6. Presentation - Formats and encrypts data for the application
7. Application - Provides network services to end-user applications
